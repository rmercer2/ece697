This is the code base associated with my final capstone project. This project aims to build a network of campus WiFi access points from time series data.
The concept of multidimensional scaling is utilized to discover spatial relationships between access points from temporal data.   

On a data set of one day of campus data and another of one week of campus data I process the data and experiment with various methods of measuring the proximity of access points to create dissimilarity matrices. The results of MDS that are visualized vary depending on how the dissimilarity of points is measured.  

One day of data:
